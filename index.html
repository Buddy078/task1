    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a first-year B.E. Computer Science and Engineering student at Bannari Amman Institute
        of Technology, passionate about programming and problem-solving.
        I enjoy working with Python, C, HTML, and CSS, and I am actively building my skills 
        through coursework and small projects. During my schooling at SSVM Mettupalayam,
        I was involved in NCC Army Wing, basketball, and event hosting, which helped me
        develop confidence, discipline, and leadership. I am also a keyboard player and
        a strong public speaker who enjoys collaborating with others and taking initiative
        in team activities. My long-term goal is to become a skilled software engineer and
        pursue higher studies abroad in the field of Computer Science
